                    <p>A blog is a great way to produce fresh content on a consistent basis. You can use your blog as a way to increase rankings for keywords that are not performing well, or as a way to engage visitors and provide educational content. Either way, if they are reading your blog, they are spending more time on our site which leads to better performance in the search engines. Also, if you can get people to share your blog, you become more credible through backlinks.</p>

                    <p>Much like a blog, a video is a great way to engage your visitors, which relates to more time spent on your website, which equals better rankings! Videos also have a much higher click through rate than plain text and carry a heavy weight in Google's algorithm. And again, if someone shares your video, more backlinks!</p>

                    <p>If your business has more than one website, there is a good chance you will not perform well in the search engines. Google likes to see consistency, and anything that may confuse them becomes spam. Best practice is to have one website, that is well optimized, and any other domains should have a 301 redirect to your main website.</p>

All of your pages should be accessible through your navigation bar, it should be easy to find, it should have crawlable text and not images, and it should flow in an order that makes sense.</p>
